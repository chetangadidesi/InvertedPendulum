# Inverted Pendulum Control: PID vs LQR Comparative Study

A comprehensive implementation and comparison of classical PID and modern LQR control strategies for the inverted pendulum system. This project demonstrates the fundamental differences between error-based feedback control and optimal state-feedback control.

## Features
- Complete mathematical modeling with state-space representation
- PID controller with anti-windup and output saturation
- LQR controller with optimal gain calculation via Riccati equation
- Real-time animation and comprehensive performance analysis
- Multiple test scenarios and comparative evaluation
